**Software Engineer | Frontend & Full Stack Web Applications**

I have 7 years of experience building and maintaining production web applications across startups and established teams. I currently work on **DrillDown**, a collaborative diagramming platform, where I focus on frontend architecture, real-time state, and long-lived codebases.

My work regularly spans the full stack, including frontend systems, backend logic, data modeling, and deployment workflows, with an emphasis on maintainability and production readiness.

## 🧠 Areas of Focus
- Architect and maintain complex **React** state and UI systems in collaborative applications
- Develop serverless backend logic using **Cloud Functions** and event-driven workflows
- Design **NoSQL** data models optimized for scalable access patterns
- Implement and manage **Firebase-backed** systems (Auth, Firestore, RTDB), including security rules and schema design
- Implement billing and payments with **Stripe**, including webhook-driven state synchronization
- Own **CI/CD**, environment configuration, and release workflows for production applications
- Emphasize test coverage, error handling, and long-term maintainability
